Welcome to this absolutely horrendous version of a Minecraft Resource Pack. This current version is 1.

CHANGELOG: VERSION 1
THE BEES AND THE BOOMS
NEW FEATURES:
-TNT is now sentient
-Both TNT Creepers now have a basic genetic system that deterimines their heritage and several of their attributes. This is done in the form of a basic Punnet Square with a dominant allele of Smurfism and a recessive allele of radicalism.
-Bees now have a successful comedy career, complete with a hit 90's sitcom.
-Bees may now seize the means of production.
BUG FIXES/OTHER FEATURES:
-A bug from an earlier small release of an in-progress test version causing sound to be played at full volume a considerable distance away has been fixed. Volume from a physical object that is not the player will now diminish in volume the further the player goes from it. This is not true for sounds which it makes sense for the player themself to be making.
-A temporary multidimensional anomaly is no longer present. 

Please report any percieved bugs to the creator. 

CHANGELOG: Version 0
-Added basic identities to the pack to allow it to be found by Minecraft
