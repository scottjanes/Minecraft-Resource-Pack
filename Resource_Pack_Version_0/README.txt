Welcome to this absolutely horrendous version of a Minecraft Resource Pack. This current version is 0, and is in Alpha. 

CHANGELOG: Version 0
-Added basic identities to the pack to allow it to be found by Minecraft



PLANNED UPDATES:
Version 1 will include more files, as well as the first actual content, which will change the sounds of a single mob for testing purposes.
Version 2 will continue to change the sounds of different mobs
The current mobs with a sound change of some sort planned assigned are: Donkeys, Foxes, Villiagers, Wandering Traders, Bees, Creepers, Elder Guardians, Ghasts, Phantoms, Witches, The Ender Dragon, and the Wither. 
Endermen, Iron Golems, and Zombies have planned sounds that are not fully confirmed to be implemented.
Bats, Pufferfish, and Mooshrooms currently are in the early phases of planning. 
Future versions will most likely include changes to noteblock sounds, as well as music disks, and other mobs.
Several designs to change the notes of different note blocks are in the early phases of planning, and one music disk has a sound that will most likely be implemented.

In total, most likely sound design will be mostly implemented before any graphical components are changed in the game, and it is possible that no graphical components will be changed.
